# SACROIS

This project uses the [SACROIS data](https://sih.ifremer.fr/Debarquements-effort-de-peche/Sacrois) to analyze them in order to dynamize certain species that are currently static in the [IAM](https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00784/89579/) forecasting model. We focus on French data from the Mediterranean sea.

This dynamization of static species could lead to better forecasts of LPUE & VPUE *(Landings / Value Per Unit of Effort)* for each species, which could potentially improve the IAM model's scenario accuracy.
